# Sneaker Reselling Market Analysis

### A Data Science Project

## Overview

The sneaker reselling market has evolved into a high-value secondary marketplace driven by demand forecasting, limited supply, and price speculation. This project applies **data science techniques** to analyze sneaker resale data and uncover patterns in pricing, demand, and market behavior.

The objective is to demonstrate an end-to-end **data science workflow**, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and insights generation to support data-driven decision-making in resale markets.

## Problem Statement

Sneaker resale prices fluctuate due to multiple factors such as brand, release timing, hype, and market demand.
This project aims to answer key analytical questions:

* What factors influence sneaker resale prices the most?
* How does demand vary across brands and categories?
* Are there observable trends that can guide profitable reselling decisions?

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains structured sneaker resale information with attributes such as:

* Sneaker brand and model
* Retail price vs resale price
* Release dates
* Market demand indicators
* Transaction-related metadata

> The dataset is analyzed strictly for educational and analytical purposes.
